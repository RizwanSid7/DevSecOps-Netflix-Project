# Azure DevSecOps Netflix Project

## Project Overview

This project showcases a secure, scalable, and cloud-native Netflix clone application deployed on Microsoft Azure with a comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline. The solution integrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization, automated security scans, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring to ensure high availability, security, and operational excellence.

---

## Key Features

- **Infrastructure provisioning** on Azure using Terraform
- **Containerized microservices** using Docker and deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)** via Azure DevOps Pipelines
- **Automated security scanning** with Trivy and SonarQube
- **Application performance monitoring and alerting** using Prometheus and Grafana
- **Helm charts** for Kubernetes deployment management
- Implementation of **DevSecOps best practices** ensuring secure and reliable software delivery

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Terraform installed
- Docker installed
- Azure DevOps account and access
- kubectl CLI installed
- Helm installed

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash

   cd DevSecOps-Netflix-Project
Provision infrastructure:
Navigate to /infrastructure and initialize Terraform:

terraform init
terraform apply
Follow prompts to deploy Azure resources.

Build and push Docker images:
Navigate to /app, build images and push to Azure Container Registry or your container repo.

Deploy to AKS:
Use Helm charts in /app or /infrastructure to deploy services on AKS cluster.

Configure CI/CD:
Import Azure DevOps pipeline YAML files from /ci-cd into your Azure DevOps project.

Run security scans:
Use Trivy and SonarQube to scan container images and code regularly as part of the CI pipeline.

Set up monitoring:
Deploy Prometheus and Grafana with the configurations in /monitoring for real-time app monitoring and alerting.
